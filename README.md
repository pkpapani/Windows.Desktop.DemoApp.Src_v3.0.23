# Windows.Desktop.DemoApp.Src_v3.0.23
RFID SDK Demo Application Source Code for Windows

The code in this repository was originally downloaded from a zip file from the Zebra website. It is a demo application for connecting and performing basic operations on a Zebra RFD8500 RFID Reader.
Since the original code needed some bug fixing, I decided to upload my changes to GitHub, to help others save time and frustration.

The original zip file is named _Windows.Desktop.DemoApp.Src_v3.0.23.zip_ and can be found at https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/developer-tools/zebra-rfid-sdk-for-windows.html.
